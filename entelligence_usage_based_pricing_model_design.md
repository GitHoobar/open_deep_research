# Implementing a Usage-Based Pricing Model with a Credits System

## Executive Summary
We're diving into enhancing our platform by adding a usage-based pricing model that harnesses a credit system. This will allow our users to experience a flexible pricing model for code review and documentation generation services. The goal is to seamlessly integrate this model into our existing backend structure, ensuring that users only pay for what they use, while offering tiered pricing to cater to different customer needs.

## Current State Deep Dive
Let's break down what we already have under the hood. Our existing codebase primarily lives in the `backend` directory, and the core files handling user management and transactions are `user/models.py`, `billing/models.py`, and `api/views.py`.

1. **User Management**: Our `User` model in `user/models.py` already handles basic authentication and profile data. However, it doesn't yet account for credits or tiers.
2. **Billing Operations**: The `Billing` module within `billing/models.py` manages user subscriptions but lacks the structure for handling dynamic credit allocations and usage metering.
3. **API Endpoints**: We have API endpoint definitions in `api/views.py`, but they will need to be extended to accommodate credit transactions and balance inquiries.

## Proposed Technical Design
### Credits System Architecture
We'll introduce a `Credit` model to manage the lifecycle of user credits. Here's how we're structuring it:

- **Initial Credit Allocation**: Allocate initial credits when users sign up or subscribe. We'll extend the `User` model in `user/models.py` to include a `credits` field.
  
- **Credit Consumption**: Define methods in `billing/models.py` for deducting credits based on usage. Each code review or documentation request will trigger a credit deduction.
  
- **Credit Management**: A new cron job or worker process will manage expiration dates and automatic renewals on `credits.py`.

### Usage Tracking & Metering
The core of this will lie in extending existing functions in `api/views.py`:

- **API Monitoring**: Enhance API methods to track calls, usage complexity, and associated credit costs.
  
- **Real-time Analytics**: Utilize Redis or a similar real-time database to track live credit usages, with additions to `usage/analytics.py`.

### Pricing Tiers & Models
We'll configure pricing models within a new `Pricing` module:

- **Free and Paid Tiers**: Define tiers with varying credit allocations and prices in `billing/pricing.py`.
  
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust pricing based on usage metrics in `pricing_logic.py`.

### Billing & Payment Integration
Integrate Stripe and potentially PayPal:

- **Subscription Management**: Expand `billing/models.py` with new methods to handle subscriptions, renewals, and credit top-ups.

- **Payment Processors**: Implement payment integration using Stripe APIs within `payments/integrations.py`.

## Implementation Tickets

1. **Extend User Model**: 
   - **File**: `user/models.py`
   - **Task**: Add a `credits` IntegerField and methods for credit operations.

2. **Define Credit Model**: 
   - **File**: `billing/credits.py`
   - **Task**: Implement a `Credit` class to manage allocation, consumption, and expiration.

3. **Upgrade API Endpoints**: 
   - **File**: `api/views.py`
   - **Task**: Add endpoints for credit balance checks, purchases, and usage stats.

4. **Setup Payment Integration**: 
   - **File**: `payments/integrations.py`
   - **Task**: Integrate Stripe for handling payments and invoices.

5. **Introduce Pricing Logic**: 
   - **File**: `billing/pricing.py`
   - **Task**: Create pricing models for different user tiers.

6. **Real-time Usage Monitoring**: 
   - **File**: `usage/analytics.py`
   - **Task**: Implement Redis-based usage tracking.

## Code Examples

Here's how we might define the `Credit` model:

```python
# billing/credits.py

from django.db import models

class Credit(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey('User', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    balance = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    expiration_date = models.DateField()

    def consume_credits(self, amount):
        if self.balance >= amount:
            self.balance -= amount
        else:
            # Trigger alert: not enough credits
            pass
```

The extended `User` model with credit handling:

```python
# user/models.py

class User(AbstractUser):
    credits = models.ForeignKey(Credit, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)

    def allocate_initial_credits(self, amount):
        if not self.credits:
            self.credits = Credit.objects.create(user=self, balance=amount)
```

## Migration & Deployment

1. **Database Migration**: Run migrations for new models and fields (`python manage.py makemigrations` and `migrate`).

2. **Integration Tests**: Deploy feature branches and conduct tests focusing on API integrations and credit deductions.

3. **Deployment Steps**: Roll out changes in stages, disaggregating credit logic implementations from usage tracking deployments to minimize risks.

## Edge Cases & Risks
### Technical Challenges
- **Race Conditions**: Ensure credit transactions are atomic, perhaps using database transactions or locks.
  
- **Scalability**: As usage grows, our system must handle increased API traffic and payment processing demands.

### Solutions
- Implement transaction management within Django or equivalent to handle atomic operations.
- Consider load balancing and caching mechanisms to handle increased API usage efficiently.

This design document should equip the development team with an actionable plan to implement a sophisticated, user-centric pricing model. The next step would be translating these tickets into actionable items within our task management system.
